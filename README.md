# Development

### Prerequisities

-   [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
-   [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (For Linux/Ubuntu, [after adding the repository](https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/install) do `sudo apt-get install git-lfs`, more info [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/INSTALLING.md))

### Getting started

-   `git clone git@github.com:trezor/trezor-suite.git`
-   `git submodule update --init --recursive`
-   `git lfs install` // Set up Git LFS for your user account. You only need to run this once per user account.
-   `git lfs pull`
-   `nvm install`
-   `yarn`
-   `yarn build:libs`

It's recommended to enable `git config --global submodule.recurse true` so you don't need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` every time when submodules are updated.

> You don't need a Cerberus device to get into the app, you can use emulator. There is a [Cerberus User Env](https://github.com/Cerberus-Wallet/cerberus-user-env) to help you set it up and run emulator for any Cerberus model ðŸŽ‰

## **Connect** @cerberus/connect

This repository is used for development of version 9 of @cerberus/connect. For detailed documentation, please refer to this [page](./docs/packages/connect/index.md).

Historically, Cerberus Connect had its [own repository](https://github.com/Cerberus-Wallet/connect). This repository is now archived.

## **Cerberus Suite** @cerberus/suite

Run a dev build:

-   `yarn suite:dev` (web app)
